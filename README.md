# Contains a tutorial on studying preferential attachment using the igraph libray in R

* I simulate graphs to depict the difference between random graphs and networks which follow the preferential attachment model
* I use the SPID dataset which contains an edgelist of latent diffusion ties to test if certain states are policy 'hubs' from whom other states borrow policy ideas extensively
